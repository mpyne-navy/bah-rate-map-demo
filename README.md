# bah-rate-map-demo

Shell repo for a live public website of BAH rate map

See https://mpyne-navy.github.io/bah-rate-map-demo (assuming this works), and
see https://github.com/mpyne-navy/bah-rate-map for the source to build the
files used on this repo.

To avoid hammering Census and DoD servers from a Github Action, this is setup
by manually copying files generated by the source repo so this may be out of
sync from time to time.
